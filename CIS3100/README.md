Course Description:

This course provides an overview of the mathematical techniques and computer tools needed in the field 
of  data  science.  The  important  types  of  problems  addressed  in  the  field  of  data  science  are  rigorously  
formulated and analyzed, including regression, pattern recognition and classification, time series prediction, 
and clustering. Effective mathematical and computational solution methodologies are discussed, including 
exploratory data analysis, statistical methods, and machine learning. At the end of the course, the student 
will have an analytic and computational toolkit with which they can solve real problems and "tell a story" 
with data.
